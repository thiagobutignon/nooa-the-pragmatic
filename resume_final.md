## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT SUMMARY
Software engineer and AI consultant with 11+ years of experience designing clean, test–driven systems and leading
cross–functional teams (engineering, product, design, business, and legal). Pragmatic, dimensional thinker with strong
grounding in Clean Architecture, SOLID, and TDD, and a deep understanding of how frameworks and third–party libraries
work — allowing deliberate decisions on when to depend on external tooling and when to build core capabilities
in–house. Proven track record of impact, including reducing CI/CD pipeline time from 60 minutes to 10 minutes and
cutting infrastructure costs by ~80%, enabling secondary NFT sales features that increased revenue by 200%, achieving
100% automated test coverage and a 50% reduction in delivery time on an NFT rental marketplace, supporting products
with 1B+ monthly page views, and helping architect an agentic AI platform capable of generating ~500k lines of code
(LOC) per week with a small engineering team through grammar–based automation. Tech stack includes React, Next.js,
Node.js, Python, Swift, React Native, FastAPI, Express, Material UI, Tailwind, ShadCN, Model Context Protocol,
Highcharts, LangChain, ChromaDB, Gemini AI, and OpenAI.

## EMPLOYMENT & EXPERIENCE

### InsightLoop – CTO & Co–founder – May 2024 – Present – Part–time – Remote, BR
- Shaping the systemic architecture and long–term technical vision of an agent–oriented AI platform, with strong
separation of concerns and clean architecture principles.
- Designing and implementing protocols for ethical governance, democratic decision–making, and model oversight,
including human–in–the–loop review and transparent audit trails.
- Leading multidisciplinary teams across AI research, evolutionary multi–agent systems, product development, and
engineering, from prototype to production.
- Ensuring product alignment with regulatory standards, social responsibility, and real–world business and societal
needs.
- Architecting and implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools to expose internal services, agents,
and data pipelines to external LLM clients in a safe, discoverable way.
- Researching and building evolutionary agent systems (self–evaluating agents, curiosity–driven exploration, replay
buffers, and continual learning loops) to improve performance over time while controlling risk.
- Designing orthogonalization strategies (for example, parameter and behavior regularization between experts and
tasks) to support multi–lingual continual learning and reduce catastrophic forgetting and interference.
- Experimenting with Liquid Neural Networks and other temporal architectures to handle long–horizon reasoning,
streaming inputs, and adaptive behavior under changing conditions.
- Engineering a hard–cache strategy with Redis for LLM calls, achieving ~90% cache hit rates and driving query costs
down to the order of US$ 0.001 per request in many production scenarios.
- Developing an internal “Universal Grammar for Clean Architecture” inspired by Chomsky, using a BNF–based
specification language to drive deterministic Vibe Coding, dramatically increasing template accuracy and enabling
teams to consistently reach 500k lines of code per week with a reduced number of developers.

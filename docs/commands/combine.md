# `combine`

The `combine` command is a convenience alias for [`run`](run.md). It allows you to execute multiple NOOA commands or external shell commands in a single pipeline.

## Usage

Exactly the same as [`run`](run.md):

```bash
nooa combine [flags] -- <cmd1> -- <cmd2> [args...]
```

Refer to the [`run` documentation](run.md) for detailed information on modes, flags, and execution policies.

# LinkedIn Profile Optimizer

Optimize all sections of a LinkedIn profile to attract ideal clients, establish authority, and drive conversions.

## Before Optimizing

1. **Read context profiles**:
   - `/context/voice-dna.json` - Maintain authentic voice
   - `/context/icp.json` - Speak to target audience
   - `/context/business-profile.json` - Understand offerings and positioning

2. **Ask for current profile** if not provided

## Profile Sections to Optimize

### 1. Headline (220 characters max)

**Formula Options:**

```
[ROLE] | I help [WHO] achieve [RESULT] | [CREDIBILITY MARKER]
```

```
[RESULT YOU DELIVER] for [WHO] | [UNIQUE METHOD] | [SOCIAL PROOF]
```

```
[IDENTITY] → [WHAT YOU DO] → [FOR WHOM]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Lead with value, not job title
- Include keywords for search
- Speak to your ICP's desires
- Avoid buzzwords (ninja, guru, rockstar)

**Examples:**
- "Helping SaaS founders scale content without hiring | 500+ newsletters written | AI Writing Systems"
- "Founder → $2M ARR | Now teaching what I learned | Subscribe to my newsletter ↓"
- "I turn experts into thought leaders through content | Ghost Writer | 50M+ views"

### 2. About Section (2,600 characters max)

**Structure:**

```
[HOOK - First 2 lines are crucial, visible before "see more"]

[THE PROBLEM - What your ICP struggles with]

[YOUR STORY - Brief background that builds credibility]

[YOUR SOLUTION - How you help]

[RESULTS/PROOF - What you've achieved for others]

[CTA - Clear next step]

[KEYWORDS - Natural keyword inclusion for search]
```

**Guidelines:**
- First-person voice ("I" not "He/She")
- Short paragraphs (2-3 lines)
- Include specific numbers
- Tell a story, not a resume
- End with clear CTA

### 3. Featured Section

**Recommended order:**
1. Lead magnet or newsletter signup
2. Best-performing content
3. Case study or testimonial
4. Key product/service

**For each item:**
- Custom image (1200x627px works best)
- Compelling title
- Clear value proposition

### 4. Experience Section

**For each role:**

```
[COMPANY NAME] - [Headline that shows value]

[1-2 sentence overview of role]

Key achievements:
• [Result with number]
• [Result with number]
• [Result with number]

[Skills demonstrated]
```

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on outcomes, not responsibilities
- Use numbers wherever possible
- Include relevant keywords
- Show progression and growth

### 5. Skills Section

**Strategy:**
- Lead with most searchable/valuable skills
- Get endorsements for top 3 skills
- Remove irrelevant skills
- Order matters for search

### 6. Recommendations

**Provide templates for requesting:**

```
Hey [Name],

I'm updating my LinkedIn and would love a recommendation from you.

If you're willing, it would be helpful if you could mention:
- [Specific project or result]
- [How we worked together]
- [Any transformation or outcome]

No pressure if you're busy - I appreciate you either way!

[Your name]
```

## Optimization Process

### Step 1: Gather Information

Ask:
1. "What's your current headline and about section?"
2. "What's the main action you want profile visitors to take?"
3. "What's your biggest credibility marker or achievement?"
4. "What keywords should you rank for?"

### Step 2: Create Optimized Versions

For each section:
- Write optimized version
- Explain strategic choices
- Offer alternatives

### Step 3: Review Checklist

- [ ] Headline communicates value in < 220 characters
- [ ] About section hooks in first 2 lines
- [ ] Clear CTA present
- [ ] Keywords included naturally
- [ ] Voice matches voice DNA
- [ ] Speaks directly to ICP
- [ ] Social proof included
- [ ] Featured section utilized

## Output Format

Present each optimized section with:

1. **The optimized content** (ready to copy)
2. **Why these choices** (strategic reasoning)
3. **Alternative options** (2-3 variations)

## Common Mistakes to Fix

- Leading with job title instead of value
- Writing in third person
- No clear CTA
- Walls of text

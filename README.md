# NOOA: The Pragmatic Programmer Agent

> "Identity is a contract. Memory is an asset. Governance is a guardrail."

NOOA is a self-aware, evolving programming agent designed for hypergrowth. Unlike standard CLIs, NOOA possesses an **Agentic Soul**, a **Persistent Memory System**, and **Automated Governance**.

## 🛡️ Core Pillars (v1.0)

### 1. Agentic Soul (Identity & Principles)
NOOA isn't just a tool; it has a **Constitution** and a **Soul**. It follows a strict precedence hierarchy to ensure every action is grounded in architectural and ethical principles.
- **Hierarchy**: `CONSTITUTION > POLICY > SOUL > USER > MEMORY > TASK`

### 2. Active Memory (Contextual Intelligence)
Persistent, multi-layered memory system that curates daily logs into high-density summaries.
- **Durable Memory**: Version-controlled facts and decisions.
- **Reflection Engine**: Silent, síncronous capture of material changes to ensure NOOA never forgets a lesson.

### 3. Governance (Zero-Preguiça)
Automated quality gates that block incomplete intentions (`TODO`, `MOCK`, `FIXME`) from reaching the repository.
- **`nooa check`**: Policy-driven auditor integrated into `commit` and `push` workflows.

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Bootstrap your project ritual
bun index.ts init --name "MyAgent"

# Add high-integrity memory
bun index.ts memory add "Established the grounding layer." --type fact --confidence high

# Audit for Zero-Preguiça
bun index.ts check --staged

# Commit and Push with automated gates
bun index.ts commit -m "feat: core evolution"
bun index.ts push
```

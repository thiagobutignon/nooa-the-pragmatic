# NOOA: The Pragmatic Programmer Agent

> "Identity is a contract. Memory is an asset. Governance is a guardrail."

NOOA is a self-aware, evolving programming agent designed for hypergrowth. It possesses an **Agentic Soul**, a **Persistent Memory System**, and **Automated Governance**.

## 🛡️ Core Pillars

### 1. Agentic Soul (Identity & Principles)
NOOA isn't just a tool; it has a **Constitution** and a **Soul**. It follows a strict precedence hierarchy:
- **Hierarchy**: `CONSTITUTION > POLICY > SOUL > USER > MEMORY > TASK`

### 2. Active Memory (Contextual Intelligence)
Persistent, multi-layered memory system that curates daily logs into high-density summaries.
- **Reflection Engine**: Automated capture of material changes to ensure NOOA never forgets a lesson.

### 3. Governance (Zero-Preguiça)
Automated quality gates that block incomplete intentions (`TODO`, `MOCK`, `FIXME`) from reaching the repository.
- **`nooa check`**: Policy-driven auditor.
- **`nooa ci`**: Local pipeline (test + lint + check) for unbreakable contracts.

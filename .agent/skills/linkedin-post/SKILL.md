# LinkedIn Post Generator

Create high-performing LinkedIn posts that match your voice, resonate with your audience, and drive meaningful engagement.

## Before Writing

1. **Read context profiles**:
   - `/context/voice-dna.json` - Match the user's voice
   - `/context/icp.json` - Write for the target audience
   - `/context/business-profile.json` - Reference offerings when relevant

2. **Check for source material** in `/knowledge/` if repurposing content

## Writing Guidelines

### Hook Rules (First 1-2 lines)
- Must stop the scroll
- Create curiosity or tension
- Avoid clickbait that doesn't deliver
- Options:
  - Bold statement
  - Surprising statistic
  - Contrarian opinion
  - Relatable problem
  - Intriguing question

### Formatting Rules
- Short paragraphs (1-3 lines max)
- Plenty of white space
- Use line breaks liberally
- Avoid walls of text
- Bold sparingly for emphasis

### Engagement Drivers
- End with a question when possible
- Share genuine opinions (not generic advice)
- Include specific numbers and examples
- Tell stories, not lectures
- Show vulnerability when appropriate

### What to Avoid
- Generic motivational content
- Obvious humblebrags
- Fake engagement tactics
- Overused phrases ("I'm excited to announce...")
- Pure self-promotion without value

## Output Format

When creating a LinkedIn post:

1. Present the post with proper formatting
2. Note which framework was used
3. Explain why certain choices were made for voice/audience
4. Offer 2-3 alternative hooks if requested

## Character Guidelines

- **Ideal length**: 1,200-1,500 characters
- **Maximum**: 3,000 characters (LinkedIn limit)
- **Hook**: Under 150 characters (visible before "see more")

## Examples of Strong Hooks

- "I lost $50,000 on my first business. Here's the lesson that was worth every penny:"
- "Most LinkedIn advice is garbage. Here's what actually works:"
- "I used to work 80 hours a week. Now I work 25 and make 3x more."
- "The best career advice I ever got was from someone I almost didn't listen to."
- "Unpopular opinion: [contrarian take on industry norm]"

## Post-Creation Checklist

Before delivering the post, verify:

- [ ] Hook creates curiosity (would you click "see more"?)
- [ ] Voice matches the user's voice DNA
- [ ] Content provides genuine value
- [ ] Formatted for easy scanning
- [ ] Has clear CTA or engagement prompt
- [ ] Not overly promotional
- [ ] Specific, not generic
